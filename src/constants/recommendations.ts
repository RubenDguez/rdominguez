    Argenis has been a fantastic addition to the team and has been converted to FTE in June 2023. 
    He has been a vital component to major initiatives this year such as leading the Salesforce CRM + LAND teams 
    with standing up a regression suite. He is constantly helping and mentoring his peers with code design, 
    reviews and feedback, and has helped our team to standardize modern reporting solutions like Allure. 
    He is on track for continuing his efforts into building out production variant suites for Salesforce, 
    as well as helping integrate the latest project PALMS into the platform. 
    I am looking forward to watch him coninue to grow both his technical and professional skillset and cannot wait to see 
    what exciting enhancements/ideas he will bring to the team.
